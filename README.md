- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for schema validation

### Development Tools

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
- [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for versioning
- [MSW](https://mswjs.io/) for API mocking
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit testing
- [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) for component testing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 9+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development

```bash
# Start Storybook and watch for changes
pnpm dev

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Lint code
pnpm lint

# Format code
pnpm format

# Clean build artifacts
pnpm clean
```

## Project Structure

### Apps & Packages

This Turborepo includes the following packages and applications:

- `apps/next-app`: A placeholder documentation site powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- `packages/config`: Shared configuration (ESLint, TypeScript, etc.)
- `packages/themes`: Shared theme configuration and color utilities
- `packages/types`: Shared TypeScript types
- `packages/ui`: Core React components
- `packages/utils`: Shared React utilities


Each package and app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Workspaces enables us to
"hoist" dependencies that are shared between packages to the root `package.json`. This means smaller
`node_modules` folders and a better local dev experience. To install a dependency for the entire
monorepo, use the `-w` workspaces flag with `pnpm add`.

This example sets up your `.gitignore` to exclude all generated files, other folders like
`node_modules` used to store your dependencies.

### Component Organization

The UI components are organized in the following structure:

```
packages/ui/src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/      # Higher-level components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/        # Feature-specific components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ primitives/      # Basic UI building blocks
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ui-shadcn/      # Shadcn UI components
```

Each component follows a standard structure:

```tsx
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ComponentName/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ComponentName.tsx      # Main component
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ComponentName.stories.tsx  # Storybook stories
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ComponentName.mdx     # Documentation
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts             # Public exports
```

## Build Tools

This monorepo uses different build tools for different packages:

- `@gitcoin/ui`: Uses Vite for building the component library with features like SVG imports, TypeScript declaration files, and CSS processing
- All other packages: Use Tsup for fast, efficient TypeScript/JavaScript bundling

## Versioning & Publishing Packages

This example uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versions, create
changelogs, and publish to npm. It's preconfigured so you can start publishing packages immediately.

You'll need to create an `NPM_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` and add it to your GitHub repository
settings to enable access to npm. It's also worth installing the
[Changesets bot](https://github.com/apps/changeset-bot) on your repository.

### Generating the Changelog

To generate your changelog, run `pnpm changeset` locally:

1. **Which packages would you like to include?** ‚Äì This shows which packages have changed and which
   have remained the same. By default, no packages are included. Press `space` to select the
   packages you want to include in the `changeset`.
1. **Which packages should have a major bump?** ‚Äì Press `space` to select the packages you want to
   bump versions for.
1. If doing the first major version, confirm you want to release.
1. Write a summary for the changes.
1. Confirm the changeset looks as expected.
1. A new Markdown file will be created in the `changeset` folder with the summary and a list of the
   packages included.

### Releasing

When you push your code to GitHub, the [GitHub Action](https://github.com/changesets/action) will
run the `release` script defined in the root `package.json`:

```bash
turbo run build --filter=@repo/*^... && changeset publish
```

Turborepo runs the `build` script for all publishable packages (excluding @repo/*) and publishes the
packages to npm. By default, this example includes `gitcoin` as the npm organization. To change
this, do the following:

- Rename folders in `packages/*` to replace `gitcoin` with your desired scope
- Search and replace `gitcoin` with your desired scope
- Re-run `pnpm install`

To publish packages to a private npm organization scope, **remove** the following from each of the
`package.json`'s

```diff
- "publishConfig": {
-  "access": "public"
- },
```
